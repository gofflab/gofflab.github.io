									   	<p>Dr. Goff is an Associate Professor of Neuroscience & Genetic Medicine in the <a href="https://igm.jhmi.edu/">McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine</a> at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His postdoctoral work was conducted under the joint mentorship of Drs. John Rinn (Harvard, SCRB) and Manolis Kellis (MIT, CSAIL) and involved the discovery, annotation, and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in a variety of cellular and developmental contexts. The Goff Lab is currently focused on developing and adapting single cell gene expression measurement systems to explore how cells in the developing and degenerating mammalian nervous system vary in response to genetic or other disease-associated insults.</p>

Whilst an undergrad, she retained membership in various honor societies, such as, Beta Beta Beta, Gamma Sigma Epsilon, and Sigma Xi. She was also highly involved in the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority. She completed a Capstone Research Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health under the mentorship of Dr. Janice Evans. This project focused on optimizing antibody conditions for determining protein localization within mouse oocytes. Briana also participated in a semester long course, at her alma mater, doing research on the role of ubiquitination and its' effect on stem cell differentiation and lineage determination. While she hopes to contribute her knowledge and dedication to our lab, she remains focused on her goal of becoming an Embryologist in the near future. </p>-->
